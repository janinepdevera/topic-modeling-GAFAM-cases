## Summary 

This project tracks competition infringement cases of five of the biggest tech companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft (GAFAM). News articles are scraped from the website of Competition Policy International (https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com). After data pre-processing, two topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Structural Topic Model) are used to derive the prominent topics in GAFAM cases. Results of the models are then compared.
